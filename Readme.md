This project is based on Stereo Vision, a very well studied and still evolving field of Computer Vision. The aim is to extract 3D information of objects from a given pair of stereo images.
The intuitive motivation is human vision system in which two images(stereo images) are formed in our eyes on retinas. Our brain does lots of computations on these images so that we are able to sense the depth of objects in the scene therefore having a 3D experience of the outside world.
